## [v3.0.0]
:rocket: The 3.0.0 release of the Changelog Enforcer is here! This release relies soley on the GitHub API instead of local git commands from a cloned repository. This means, for example, that `actions/checkout` does **not** need to be run before running the enforcer.

## [v2.2.0]
### Changed
- The `pull_request` workflow now executes as a `pull_request_target` workflow to handle incoming pull requests from forked repos.
  - This is needed because Dependabot now works as a [forked branch](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/). The reasoning and ways to accommodate are listed in a [GitHub Security article](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
  - The `verified` label is needed to allow the workflow to execute

- Bumps `hosted-git-info` from 2.8.8 to 2.8.9

## [v2.1.0]
### Deprecated
- The input `versionPattern` is now deprecated. Starting in `v3.0.0` the Changelog Enforcer will only work with [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for verifying the latest expected version.
### Dependencies

  - Adds a new property `missingUpdateErrorMessage` for passing a custom error message when no update is found to the changelog. See the [Inputs / Properties](https://github.com/dangoslen/changelog-enforcer#inputs--properties) section in the `README.md` for more information.
  - Adds a new output `errorMessage` that states why the Changelog Enforcer failed. Added to allow users to use the error message within the rest of the action workflow.

## [v1.5.0]
### Added
- New input parameter `expectedLatestVersion`.
  - When supplied, the Changelog Enforcer validates that this is the latest version in the changelog or the latest version after an "Unreleased" version if one exists.
- New input parameter `versionPattern`.
  - Used in conjunction with `expectedLatestVersion`. This is a javascript string that is converted to a regular expression that is used to extract the versions in the changelog identified by the `changeLogPath` input.
